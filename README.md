### What is this?
- Just learning ReactJS, Redux.
- want to imitate character selection menu that you have in overwatch but in a longterm goal, if I could get tournament stats allow users to compare their preferred compositions and provide analytics for that.



### Personal Garbage Notes
STATE
- map
- your_team [player1, player2, ...]
- other_team [player1, player2...] # randomly chosen from submitted teams in the past or generated seed data

RELATED_TO_STATE
game_mode: escort (attack/defense), assault (attack/defense), control (neutral), hybrid (assualt + hybrid)
- this is determined by the map


REFERENCE:
- for images: https://findoverwatch.com/images/heroes/

TODO:
reducers:
- add click handler for selected team member
- add click handler for hero selection
